        <h3>What is a webpage?</h3>
     
    <p>A web page is a simple document displayable by a browser. Such documents are written in the <strong>HTML language.</strong>
        A website is a collection of linked web pages (plus their associated resources) that share a unique domain name. Each web page of a given website provides explicit links—most of the time in the form of clickable portions of text—that allow the user to move from one page of the website to another
        Many beginners on the web confuse search engines and browsers. Let's make it clear: A browser is a piece of software that retrieves and displays web pages; a search engine is a website that helps people find web pages from other websites. The confusion arises because, the first time someone launches a browser, the browser displays a search engine's homepage. This makes sense, because, obviously, the first thing you want to do with a browser is to find a web page to display. Don't confuse the infrastructure (e.g., the browser) with the service (e.g., the search engine).
        The distinction will help you quite a bit, but even some professionals speak loosely, so don't feel anxious about it.

    <p><b>HTML</b> stands for <i>HyperText Markup Language.</i> It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
        HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
        Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
        Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

    <p><strong>Don't confuse websites and web servers.</strong> For example, if you hear someone say, <em>"My website is not responding"</em>, it actually means that the web server is not responding and therefore the website is not available. More importantly, since a web server can host multiple websites, the term web server is never used to designate a website, as it could cause great confusion. In our previous example, if we said, <em>"My web server is not responding"</em>, it means that multiple websites on that web server are not available.</p>
